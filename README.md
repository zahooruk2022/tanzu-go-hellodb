# Tanzu Go HelloWorld

This project provides a simple Go web service. The service is deployable on the Tanzu Application Platform without further dependencies or services. It provides a web service that responds with a greeting and a unique ID for your visit.

It is a great starting point for demos, or simple http services. For more complex applications that require backing services see other `tanzu-go-*` accelerators.
